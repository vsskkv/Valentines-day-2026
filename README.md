# Valentine's Day Website ❤️

A simple, cute, and interactive website to ask your girlfriend to be your Valentine.

## How to host on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub (e.g., `valentines-2026`).
2. **Upload these files** (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to the repository.
3. **Go to Settings** of your repository.
4. On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
5. Under **Build and deployment > Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
6. Wait a minute or two, and GitHub will provide you with a link (usually `https://yourusername.github.io/valentines-2026/`).

## Features
- **Interactive "No" Button**: The button runs away when she tries to click it!
- **Celebration**: A cute message and animation when she clicks "Yes".
- **Floating Hearts**: A sweet background animation.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on phones!

Happy Valentine's Day! ❤️
